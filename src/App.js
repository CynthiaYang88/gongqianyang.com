				<h3>Gong-Qian Yang</h3>
				<p>Yang’s music is in 21st century modern classical music style ranging from Choral, movie sound
					track, TV, radio headlines and gaming music, soundscape, to symphonic works such as "Nature and
					Me " Symphonic Poem and "Dawn-Awakening", etc… His music is natural, easy listening, uplifting
					and inspirational.</p>
				<p>As a composer, producer and publisher, Gong Qian Yang has released seven of his music albums:
					Sonic Poem, Sonic Spring, Sonic Wave, Lean on Me, Music for Yoga and More, Sonic Fusion, Space
					and Stars, etc... "Space and Stars” is Yang's inspiration for communication with nature: Birds,
					Forest, Seashore, Wave, Wind, Night sky, Moon and twinkling stars....</p>
				<p>As an accomplished violinist, Yang has been twice first-prize winner of the Starling
					International Scholarship Foundation in U.S. He pursued his violin study with the legendary
					violin teacher Prof. Dorothy Delay and Prof. Kurt Sassmannshaus at both Aspen music Festival and
					Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music (CCM). Yang has been conferred Master's Degree of
					Music. Yang also studied with Ms. Kathleen Lenski, and Prof.Robert Lipsett earlier when he was
					in California.</p>
				<p>Yang very much enjoyed taking composer Joel Hoffman's class at CCM. He was also very grateful to
					his music mentor Gerhard Samuel (who studied composition with Paul Hindemith, and studied
					conducting with Koussevitzky). Yang was coached and influenced by Prof. Samuel on modern music
					languages and new music for the future. Fortunately, Yang was offered the opportunity to play
					Prof. Samuel's Gagliano violin during the time while he was studying at CCM.</p>
				<p>While enjoying a successful career as soloist and concert artist, Yang always kept keen interest
					in music composition. Focusing on his music production, Yang has studied a wide range of
					repertoire and a great diversity of music by western masters. As a sensible composer, Yang has
					often been inspired by the harmony between all the creatures in the universe. A lot of his music
					idea came to him when he was on his music tour. He was humming along on the way to Nashville,
					and his heart was singing when he was driving in the Appalachian Mountains. Yang says he enjoys
					being close to the nature whether it is sunny or rainy; he feels the energy and harmony coming
					from everywhere.</p>
				<p>Yang expressed that music should radiate infinite life energy that glorifies the beauty of the
					great universe and of course the beauty of humans living within.</p>
				<p>Gong Qian Yang's music albums are available at: Apple iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, Verizon,
					Amazon MP3, Tencent Music, Netease Music, Nokia, My Space Music, Tradebit, Napster, Emusic, etc.
					Yang’s music has been well recerived both in U.S. and internationally, for his music is reaching
					and touching human hearts in a very intimate way...</p>
